# Python Challenge

This project is meant to exercise how to:
*Read .csv files
*Extract data from .csv files
*Run calculations on extracted data
*Display results both in the terminal and a .txt output file


## PyBank

In this project, we read the budget_data.csv file in our Resources folder.  We extract the Date data to calculate the total number of months.  We also extract the Profit/Loss data to calculate the Net P/L, the greatest MoM increases and decreases in P/L including the months in which those occurred, and the average change in P/L per month.

The results are printed both in the Python terminal and in an output text file for easy reading.
