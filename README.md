# Python Challenge

This project is meant to exercise how to:

+Read .csv files
+Extract data from .csv files
+Run calculations on extracted data
+Use dictionaries and key value lookups
+Display results both in the terminal and a .txt output file


## PyBank

In this project, we read the budget_data.csv file in our Resources folder.  We extract the Date data to calculate the total number of months.  We also extract the Profit/Loss data to calculate the Net P/L, the greatest MoM increases and decreases in P/L including the months in which those occurred, and the average change in P/L per month.

The results are printed both in the Python terminal and in an output text file for easy reading.


## PyPoll

In this project, we read through election_data.csv file in our Resources folder.  We extract the data to calculate the total number of votes cast, how many votes each candidate received both in count and percent of total, and determine the winner based on the percent popular vote calculation.

The results are printed both in the Python terminal and in an output text file for easy reading.
